I am a final-year PhD Candidate in the Department of [REC](https://www.arch.hku.hk/programmes_/rec/) at HKU. <br>
My research interests include real estate, government behavior, and machine learning. <br> 
I enjoy [playing video games](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2358720/), [watching movies](https://movie.douban.com/subject/1292434/), [listening to music](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QR4y1c7v7/), [reading novels](https://book.douban.com/subject/4913064/), and hiking.<br>

I am on the job market this year and actively seeking job opportunities. <br> I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know of any roles that might be a good fit.
