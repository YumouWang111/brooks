    "text": "China’s economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development that is called “new normal” and China’s construction industry plays a pillar part in China’s economy. Nevertheless, the industry is large but not strong. This labour-intensive industry suffers from low concentration and fierce competition. Based on the organizational theory, which shows how market structure contributes to the growth of industry, this study aims to explore the impact of market concentration and market power on firm’s turnover and profit. Using statistical analysis and panel data of 37 China’s construction companies from 2009 to 2018, this study proposes and calculates the market concentration (CR) and the market power (MP) of China’s companies. Then the augmented Cobb–Douglas production function and OLS regression are used to explore the growth factors of China’s construction industry. The results show that the market concentration increases both the turnover and profit of construction firms. However, market power increases the profit of construction firms while decreases the turnover. In addition, the companies that are China’s non-state-owned have overseas income or are civil engineering and construction have more advantages in the growth of the construction industry in “quality”. This study provides a reference to understand the structures of the construction industries and the structural effect on the growth of different types of firms and could be replicated in other countries with the similar situation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper examines the relationship between housing policy interventions and market returns in China with a novel policy index. Using natural language processing techniques, we construct a sentence-level policy index based on government policy documents from 2008 to 2024. The policy index identifies three loosening periods and two tightening periods in Chinese housing market. We find that the policy index is associated with higher long-term housing returns. The mechanism analysis shows that policy effects on housing returns are transmitted primarily through supply channels (43%) and demand channels (15%). Notably, our findings reveal that only loosening measures are significantly associated with housing returns. Granger causality tests uncover an asymmetric temporal relationship: while housing returns Granger-cause policy changes across all time horizons, policy interventions demonstrate causality only for long-term housing returns, suggesting a delayed impact of policy implementation on market outcomes."
